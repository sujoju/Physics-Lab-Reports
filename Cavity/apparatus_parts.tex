 \\
 \hline
 EOM
 &
 To modulate the laser beam. This will allow for us to find both the FSR and Finesse of the cavity.
 &
 EO-PM-R-20-C1
 \\
 \hline
 50/50 Beam Splitter
 &
 Splits our laser beam half-half. This will allow for us to observe different spatial modes as well as help with finding the FSR and Finesse of the cavity.
 &
 BSW10
 \\
 \hline
 Front Mirror
 &
 Cavity front mirror. It is a flat mirror ($R=\infty$) with reflectivity of about 99\%
 &
 BB1-E03
 \\
 \hline 
 Rear Mirror 
 &
 Cavity rear mirror. It is a concave mirror ($R = 3 \si{m}$) with reflectivity of about 99.9\%
 &
 TLM1-780-0-1025-3.00C
 \\
 \hline 
 Transmission Power Detector
 &
 To measure the transmission power. We should note that this detector has a high gain, but low response time ($\tau \sim 100 \si{\mu s}$).
 &
 PDA36A2
 \\
 \hline 
 Reflection Power Detector
 &
 To measure the reflected power. Note that this detector has a low gain, but fast response time ($\tau< 10 \si{n s}$).
 &
 PDA10A
 \\
 \hline 
 CMOS Camera 
 &
 To observe the special mode of the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity. This camera also helps us align the cavity in the beginning.
 &
 DCC1545M
